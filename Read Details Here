Developed and implemented a system to calculate battery watt consumption for trucks, comparing idle vs. non-idle average usage to support performance and efficiency analysis.

Integrated a fuel price management feature that either retrieves updates automatically via an API on a weekly basis or allows for manual updates through email notifications, ensuring accurate and up-to-date fuel cost data.

Built a geofencing module to verify whether each truck’s latitude and longitude coordinates fall inside or outside predefined geographic zones, improving route monitoring and compliance tracking.

Computed and displayed each truck’s average fuel price across operational periods for performance reporting and cost optimization.

Developed an automated email reporting module with customizable email templates and user-specific schedules — allowing different users to send and receive reports at their own configured times.

Implemented a user settings interface within the application where users can create, edit, and manage their email delivery preferences directly through the system.

Ensured flexibility and reliability in report distribution by integrating dynamic scheduling and personalized content rendering.

Developed a task scheduler and tracker that synchronizes each server’s name, IP, and active tasks with a central database, ensuring no scheduled jobs are lost after restarts. 
Implemented persistent task storage and automatic recovery to maintain reliable execution across multiple servers.

Developed an Application Pool monitor that detects when an app pool goes down, automatically sends email notifications to relevant users, and restarts the pool immediately to ensure minimal downtime and continuous service availability.

Enhanced an existing application to a new version with a cleaner interface and improved performance, optimizing its process of sending water level data every 15 minutes for faster and more reliable reporting.

All modules were designed and implemented using MSSQL, C#, and Windows Forms, ensuring efficient database operations and a user-friendly desktop interface.
